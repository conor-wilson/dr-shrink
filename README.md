# Dr. Shrink and the Horrors of the Infinite

[Click here to play the game!](https://quietlantern.itch.io/dr-shrink-and-the-horrors-of-the-infinite)

**DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE IS HIDEOUS!** This was a 72-hour game jam. This code was written on the fly while I was learning how to make a platformer, and much of it was written in the wee hours of the morning. The code is completely horrible, not commented, copy/pasted, duplicated, etc... DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CODE! You have been warned.

## Game Description: 

EUREKA! Dr. Shrink has finally perfected the formula for his shrinking potion! He just forgot one little thing: how is he going to grow back??

A silly little platformer where you fight past the tiny creatures in Dr. Shrink's lab multiple times, growing smaller and smaller each time.

This was made in 72 hours as my submission for Ludum Dare 56! [[Link to Submission Page]](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56/dr-shrink-and-the-horrors-of-the-infinite)

## Options for the Future:
If I ever return to this (which I very well may not), here's some desirable changes that would be nice to add: 
- Fix the hideous code.
- Create original sprite art for Dr. Shrink and enemies.
- Fix up background art to be less plain.
- Add lesser combat ability before you acquire Shrink Catalyst.
- Add pause/options menu.
- Add more levels?
- Improve sound to be more responseive to what's happening.
- Prevent enemies from escaping their area.
- Improve background (it's very plain).
- Add respawn instead of completely restarting the game

Again, if none of the above gets added ever, I'm still happy and still think it's a finished product.
